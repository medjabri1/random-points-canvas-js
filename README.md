# Random points canvas
Simple example of animating points objects in **`Javascript`** using the **_`canvas API`_**.
<br><br>
The points are **_generated_** with different **_movement speed_** and different **_size_** using the **_`Math.Random()`_** _method_.
<br><br>
This code will make the _points_ bounce back after **_exceeding_** the edges of the canvas with certain amount of space.
<br><br>
And we have also control over showing either the points moving or only the lines connecting them or both of them.
